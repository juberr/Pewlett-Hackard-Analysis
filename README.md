# Pewlett-Hackard and the "Silver Tsunami"

## Overview

The "Silver Tsunami" is a term coined to describe the incoming wave of "Baby Boomers" who are reaching retirement age. This "Silver Tsunami" is of great concern to organizations because it will leave a large volume of job vacancies without a  clear way to fill them.

This report assesses the impact of the "Silver Tsunami" on Pewlett-Hackard by quantifying how many vacancies to expect job title. Additionally, this report finds those who are eligible for a mentorship program that will help mitigate the effects of the "Silver Tsunami".

## Results

### Number of Retirees by Job Title

* The total number of predicted retirees is <b>90,398</b>.

* The jobs with the largest number of predicted vacancies are "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff". This follows as those in senior positions are generally older. Pewlett-Hackard should prioritize these positions as they prepare for the "Silver Tsunami".

* The number of Mangers anticipated to leave is suspiciously low. Is our database not tracking these correctly?



### Mentorship Eligibility

* The total number of those eligible for mentorship is <b>1,549</b>.

* As this number is significantly less than the total number of predicted retirees, those eligible for mentorship will have a wealth of experience to learn from this program.


## Summary

* As the "Silver Tsunami" makes its impact on organizations, Pewlett-Hackard should estimate that there will be <b>90,398</b> roles to fill over the course of it.

* The number of retirement-ready employees (<b>90,398</b>)  is much larger than the number of mentorship-ready employees (<b>1,549</b>). While this means the current Pewlett-Hackard talent pool has a wealth of experience to learn from, they will not be able to fully replace the "Silver Tsunami" with this program alone. Pewlett-Hackard should consider external methods to compensate.

* A query to consider would be to append the current annual salary cost of the 90,398 predicted to Retirees by title. With salary cost in mind, this can incentivize Pewlett-Hackard to research alternatives to hiring direct replacements for the "Silver Tsunami" (e.g. technological advancements to replace the labour capacity of those retiring).

* Another query to consider is the amount of "new hires" within Pewlett-Hackard (say within the past year). This will give Pewlett-Hackard a current look at their hiring rate, and get a better sense of how to adjust their hiring rate as the "Silver Tsunami" approaches.
