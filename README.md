# Pewlett-Hackard and the "Silver Tsunami"

## Overview

The "Silver Tsunami" is a term coined to describe the incoming wave of "Baby Boomers" who are reaching retirement age. This "Silver Tsunami" is of great concern to organizations because it will leave a large volume of job vacancies without a  clear way to fill them.

This report assesses impact of the "Silver Tsunami" on Pewlett-Hackard by quantifying how many vacancies there will be by job title. Additionally, this report finds those who are eligible for mentorship to be ready to fill these soon to be vacant roles across the organization.

## Results

### Vacancies by Job Title

INSERT PICTURE HERE

* The total number of predicted retirees is <b>90,398</b>.

* The jobs with the largest number of predicted vacancies are "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff". This follows as those in senior positions are generally older. Pewlett-Hackard should prioritize these positions as they prepare for the "Silver Tsunami".



### Mentorship Eligibility

INSERT PICTURE HERE

* The number of those elgibile for mentorship is <b>1549</b>

* As this number is significantly less than the total number of predicted retirees, Pewlett-Hackard should find additional solutions to the "Silver Tsunami". Other solutions to consider are hiring external mentors to supplement the job transitions, and creating learning resources to supplement the knowledge transfer the mentorship program would deliver.


## Summary

* As the "Silver Tsunami" makes an impact on organizations, Pewlett-Hackard should estimate there will be <b>90,398</b> roles to fill as Baby Boomers retire.

* The number of qualified, retirement-ready employees (<b>1,549</b>) is not enough to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The ratio of mentor to mentee would be approximately <b>1:58</b>, which would not be a healthy learning environment.

* A  query to consider would append the current annual salary cost of the 90,398 predicted to retire by title. With salary cost in mind, this can incentivize Pewlett-Hackard to research alternatives to hiring direct replacements for the "Silver Tsunami" (e.g. technological advancements to replace labour).

* Another query to consider is a view of retirees by department rather than job title. This would allow Pewlett-Hackard to know if any departments may be unporportionally affected by the "Silver Tsunami".
